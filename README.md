## Hi there! I'm MartynaðŸ‘‹ 

I am just taking my first steps on the path to starting a career in the IT industry. I have become interested in web development. I have developed and acquired all the necessary skills and knowledge through over half a year of learning and working on my own projects. I consider myself an ambitious person who perseveres in pursuing my goals. I am keen on further developing both the skills I already possess and acquiring new ones that are useful, as well as gaining new experiences.
